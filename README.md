Assignment 
The python code works as follows. Once executed, you have some options, 
first to view all students. This returns the info of all the students that 
have been registered, providing information like their name, matricule, age, cgpa, 
also having an "outstanding" entry, which tells if the student failed a course or not.

eligibility menu which does checks ensuring cgpa greater than or equal to 2.5, 
student hasn't failed a course and student is active. Next we have the find top performer 
menu which checks for the best performing student, we have the analysis

like intersection providing information like students who are on both the set_pass
and set_merit sets.
